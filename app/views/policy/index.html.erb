<b>Personally identifiable information</b><br><br>
FIDonce collects personally identifiable information directly from the User only when the User voluntarily enters information, or when the User requests or agrees that FIDonce send the User information or materials. FIDonce may also collect information through the use of promotional email campaigns or newsletters.<br><br>
The types of personally identifiable information FIDonce collects include e-mail address, full name, full address, work, home or mobile phone numbers, age, gender and viewing preferences. FIDonce currently uses the information for the purposes of providing the User with information requested by the User, and service information, and to allow the User to voluntarily participate in events, promotions, contests or sweepstakes.FIDonce may also use personally identifiable information to process user requests and/or to send the User communications from FIDonce such as news, information and promotional offers. If the User requests information for certain offers, promotions, contests or sweepstakes, FIDonce may forward the User's personal information to a third party for the purposes of supporting FIDonce in these services.<br><br>
FIDonce may disclose your personal and account information to respond to court subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes, as required by law, or to establish or exercise FIDonce legal rights or defend against legal claims. Your personal and account information may also be disclosed in connection with a sale of some or all of the FIDonce business or a merger with another entity. Within FIDonce, we restrict access to information and data about you to those FIDonce employees who need to know the information and data in order to perform their jobs, such as servicing your account, or notifying you of new services, classes, and programs.<br><br><b>

For your protection, FIDonce strongly recommends that you do not share your account information, passwords or code words with others. Administrators of the Services will never ask you for your password by phone or e-mail. Do not provide confidential information online or over the telephone unless you initiated the contact, know the party with whom you are dealing, and provide the information through a secured channel. When conducting business over the Internet, always use a secure browser or client and exit online applications as soon as you finish using them. If you become aware of any suspicious activity relating to your account, it is your responsibility to contact FIDonce immediately.<br><br>
<b>Security of Personally Identifiable Information</b><br><br>
To protect your personal information, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to ensure online data and information privacy and security.

However, FIDonce cannot guarantee the privacy and security of any information or data that is disclosed online.<br><br><b>

The Services, including the FIDonce Internet sites, FIDonce mobile applications, FIDonce-branded social media websites and third party websites that FIDonce may use to host FIDonce bulletin boards, comments pages or other areas identified as administered by FIDonce will occasionally allow User to post comments.
